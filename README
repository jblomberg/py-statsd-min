# py-statsd-min

A minimal Python implementation of Etsy's [statsD].

## Motivations

* [py-statsd] doesn't handle namespaces the way I wanted, and includes a fair
  amount of code for graphite support which I don't need.
* [statsite] felt very complicated, and was difficult for me to understand
  and modify.
* Wanted support for 'gauges', as recently added to statsD in this
  [pull request][gauges-pull]


## Inspirations
* [statsD]
* [py-statsd]
* [statsite]
